Status list
===========

Once submitted to Soma-workflow, the jobs, workflows and file transfers are 
associated to statuses which reflect their states in the system. Here is the 
list of possible statuses for each class of objects.

.. _job-status:

Job status 
==========

Here is the list of the job statuses and the associated icons displayed in the GUI.

  |no_status| **not_submitted**
    The job was not submitted yet to soma-workflow.

  |undeter| **undetermined**
    Transitive status. The job status is changing and will be updated soon.

  |pending| **submission_pending**
    Due to a limitation of the number of job in the queue (see :ref:`conf_server_option`), the job is 
    waiting to be submitted to the DRMS.
  
  |queued| **queued_active**
    The job was submitted to the DRMS and is currently waiting in the queue.
  
  |running| **running**
    The job is running on the computing resource.

  |success| or |failed| **done**
    The job finished normally. However it does not mean that it ended with 
    success (see :ref:`job-exit-status`).

  |failed| **failed**
    The job exited abnormally before finishing.

  |warning| **warning**
    The workflow engine process in charge of the monitoring of the job status
    was killed or failed. The job or the workflow containing the job has to be 
    stopped and restarted.

  **delete_pending**    
    Transitive status. The job will be deleted soon.

  **kill_pending**       
    Transitive status. The job will be killed soon.

.. _job-exit-status:

Job exit status
===============  

  **finished_regularly**
    The job finished regularly. The exit value is displayed in the GUI and is 
    available from the Python API. If the value is different from 0 
    Soma-workflow considers that the job failed.

  **finished_signal**
    The job finished due to a signal. The signal is displayed on the GUI and 
    is available from the python API (depending on DRMAA implementation).

  **killed_by_user**
     The job was killed by the user.

  **aborted**
    The job never ran.

  **exit_status_undetermined**
    The exit status can not be determined.

..
  **finished_unclear_condition**
    The job finished with unclear conditions.


.. _workflow-status:

Workflow status
===============

  |no_status| **worklflow_not_started**
    The workflow was not submitted to Soma-workflow.
  
  |running| **workflow_in_progress**
    The workflow was submitted to Soma-workflow.

  |done| **workflow_done**
    The workflow is done.

  **delete_pending**
    Transitive status. The workflow will be deleted soon.

  |warning| **warning**
    The workflow engine process in charge of the workflow execution was killed 
    or failed on the computing resource side. The workflow has to be stopped and 
    restarted (the jobs which ended with success will not be restarted).


.. note::
  |warning| In case of warning status a simple solution is to stop and 
  restart the workflow. 
  The job which ended with success will not be restarted.

  However, the warning status does not mean that the jobs failed. In case of very 
  long jobs, you can check yourself the status of the job(s) on the DRMS and 
  choose to stop the jobs from the DRMS or not.


.. _file-transfer-status:

File Transfer status
====================

  |tr_dont_exist| **do not exist**
    The file(s) do not exist. For example: output files at the beginning of a
    workflow execution.

  |tr_on_c| **on client side**
    The file(s) exist on the client side only. For example: input files.

  |tr_on_cr| **on computing resource side**
    The file(s) exist on the computing resource side only. For example: output
    files after the end of a job.

  |tr_on_both| **on both sides**
    The file(s) exist both on the client and computing resource side. For example:
    A transfer ended.  

  |tr_c_to_cr| **transfering client->cr**
    The file(s) are being transfered form the client to the computing resource.

  |tr_cr_to_c| **transfering cr->client**
    The file(s) are being transfered from the computing resource to the client.

..
  |under_edition| **under edition**
    The file(s) are under edition, they are output and/or input of a running 
    job.
