Mono process application on a multiple core machine
===================================================

**No configuration is needed to use Soma-workflow on a multiple core machine.**

See `Soma-workflow main page <http://brainvisa.info/soma-workflow>`_ for installation.


.. _client_intall_config:


Client-server application: Client
=================================

This page describes the installation and configuration of the Soma-workflow client.


Requirements
------------

* Python *version 2.7 or more*
* `ZeroMQ <http://zeromq.org>`_
* `Paramiko <http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>`_ *version 1.7 or more*. Paramiko in
  only required if the computing resource is remote (see config).
* For the GUI: Qt *version 4.6.2 or more*, `PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ *version 4.7.2 or more*, or `PySide <http://www.pyside.org>`_ *version 1.1.1 or more* and optionally `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ *version 0.99 or more*

Installation
------------

1. Download: `soma-workflow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soma-workflow>`_

2. Installation:

      ::

        $ sudo python setup.py install
        or
        $ python setup.py install --prefix my_directory



Start the GUI with the command *soma_workflow_gui* and/or import the soma_workflow.client module to use the Python API.

.. seealso:: :ref:`gui` for the GUI documentation, :ref:`client_api` for Soma-workflow Python API documentation and :ref:`examples`.


..
  The client only need the Soma-workflow modules to be installed and the
  soma_workflow_gui file to be located in the PATH


.. _client_configuration:

Configuration (Created automatically)
-------------------------------------

The configuration syntax is the `ConfigParser <http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_  syntax. The configuration file is located in "$HOME/.soma-workflow.cfg". This file will be created automatically once a server has been established (see :ref:`server_management`).

There is one section for each computing resource (that is for each Soma-workflow database server).

Only four items are required:

  * CLUSTER_ADDRESS
  * SUBMITTING_MACHINES only for remote ssh tunneling
  * QUEUES
  * LOGIN

The two first items are mandatory and the last ones are
optional. The values of these configuration items are set up at each
Soma-workflow server installation (see :ref:`server_configuration`). Ask these item values to the Soma-workflow administrator if you did not install the server yourself.

The second item, ``SUBMITTING_MACHINES``, is mandatory when the server connection is on a remote machine, and optional when client and server is the same machine (and does not require a ssh connection and tunneling). The general case thus is to use ssh and provide ``SUBMITTING_MACHINES``. The local client/server mode however may be useful to allow client disconnections (and for testing purposes).

Configuration file example (2 computing resources are configured): ::

  [Titan]

  CLUSTER_ADDRESS     = titan.mylab.fr
  SUBMITTING_MACHINES = titan0

  QUEUES = test long
  LOGIN = my_login_on_titan


  [LabDesktops]

  CLUSTER_ADDRESS     = mydesktop.mylab.fr
  SUBMITTING_MACHINES = mydesktop

*Configuration items required on the client side*

  **CLUSTER_ADDRESS**
    Address of the host computing resource host to log on.
    Address of the host which has to be used to access the cluster remotely.

  **SUBMITTING_MACHINES**
    Address of the submitting hosts, that are the hosts from which the jobs
    are supposed to be submitted. In most of the cases, there is only one
    submitting host. The addresses are local on the cluster.
    Syntax: "host1 host2 host3"


.. _conf_client_option:

*Configuration items optional on the client side:*

.. _allowed_python_versions:

  **ALLOWED_PYTHON_VERSIONS**
    *Added in Soma-Workflow 3.0*

    a coma-separated list of major python versions that can be used with the
    resource. It can be used to filter out unmatching versions so that the
    GUI automatically connects to a matching one, and does not allow to connect
    to others.

  **LOGIN**
    To pre-fill the login field in the GUI when login to the resource.

  **QUEUES**
    List of the available queues. This item is only used in the GUI to make
    easier the selection of the queue when submitting a workflow.
    Syntax: "queue1 queue2 queue3"



.. _server:


Client-server application: Server
=================================

This page explains how to configure, install and run the Soma-workflow
database server.

In the client-server mode the communication between the processes is done using
the module zro which is included in the soma_workflow package and is inspired on `Pyro4 <https://pythonhosted.org/Pyro4/>`_ syntax and uses the zmq package. In principle object are registered to the zro object server. At registration an uri is produced which can be used by other programs to instanciation proxy objects.A method call on a proxy object will contact the remote object and return its answer. For instance, the Workflow Engines query a proxy object of the database server to call its method.

.. _server_requirements:

Requirements
------------

.. image:: images/third_parties.*
  :scale: 40

Here is the list of the server dependencies:

* A distributed resource management system (DRMS) such as Grid Engine, Condor,
  Torque/PBS, LSF..
* A implementation of `DRMAA <http://www.drmaa.org/>`_ 1.0 for the DRMS in C if available, unless a specific :doc:`scheduler exists <scheduler>`
* Python *version 2.7 or more*
* `zmq <http:/zeromq.org>`_ 
* `SQLite <http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html>`_ *version 3 or more*

The implementations of DRMAA tested successfully with Soma-workflow:

  ===================  ===========================================
  DRMS                 DRMAA implementation
  ===================  ===========================================
  Torque 2.0.0         `PBS DRMAA 1.0.13 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pbspro-drmaa/files/pbs-drmaa/1.0/>`_ from http://apps.man.poznan.pl/trac/pbs-drmaa
  LSF 7.0              FedStage LSF DRMAA 1.0.3
  Grid Engine 6.2u5&6  Embeded implementation
  Condor 7.4.0         Embeded implementation
  ===================  ===========================================

On the contrary, we had problems with the following implementations:

  ===================  ===========================================
  DRMS                 DRMAA implementation
  ===================  ===========================================
  PBSPro 18.1.2        DRMAA is failing, use the :ref:`PBSPro scheduler <pbspro>`
  ===================  ===========================================

.. _server_management:

Server installation using "Server Management"
---------------------------------------------

In the menu of soma-workflow, we can see a button called, Server Management.
See the menu of the below figure, we can find a "Server Management" button

.. image:: images/ServerManagementMenu.*
  :scale: 100

Opening "Server Management" button, and then we can see three buttons, called:
Add Server, Remove Server, Remove Server on Client, as shown in
the below figure. Since the configuration is needed for both sides (client and server), "Remove Server" means that remove the installation on the server and client (BE CAREFULL: it will lose all your soma-workflow data on your server and client, $HOME/.soma-workflow and $HOME/.soma-workflow.cfg). "Remove Server on Client" means that it will remove all the data only on client side, while the server side is still running as usual.

.. image:: images/ServerManagement.*
  :scale: 100

Opening "Add Server" button, we can see a window as shown below:

.. image:: images/ServerManagementAddServer.*
  :scale: 100

Before the server installation, we strongly recommend to use SSH with authentication key instead of password. See "http://askubuntu.com/questions/46930/how-can-i-set-up-password-less-ssh-login". Otherwise, you need to input password each time. We should setup the Server Address, SSH Login, while the other items are optional. (password is not mandatory when you are using authentication key)

Since the configuration is needed for both sides (client and server),
the first button, called "Install on Server and Client", is used for configuring both sides. Since many clients can connect to one server, "Setup Client without Installation on Server" is used for configurating only client side.

Since soma-workflow is based on the DRMAA on the server side, to make sure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains libdrmaa.so or export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH to the absolute path of libdrmaa.so on your server.


.. _server_configuration:

Server configuration (Created automatically)
--------------------------------------------

This section defines the required and optional configuration items. This file can be found on the both side of client and server with the path "$HOME/.soma-workflow.cfg".

The configuration file syntax is the `ConfigParser <http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_  syntax. All the configuration items are defined in one section. The name of
the section is the resource identifier (ex: "Titan").


Configuration file example: ::

  [Titan]

  DATABASE_FILE        = path/soma_workflow.db
  TRANSFERED_FILES_DIR = path/transfered_files
  SERVER_NAME          = soma_workflow_server_for_titan

  # optional limitation of the jobs in various queues
  MAX_JOB_IN_QUEUE = {10} test{50} long{3}
  MAX_JOB_RUNNING  = {100} test{500} long{30}

  # optional logging
  SERVER_LOG_FILE   = path/logs/log_server
  SERVER_LOG_FORMAT = %(asctime)s => line %(lineno)s: %(message)s
  SERVER_LOG_LEVEL  = ERROR
  ENGINE_LOG_DIR    = path/logs/
  ENGINE_LOG_FORMAT = %(asctime)s => line %(lineno)s: %(message)s
  ENGINE_LOG_LEVEL  = ERROR

  # remote access information
  CLUSTER_ADDRESS     = titan.mylab.fr
  SUBMITTING_MACHINES = titan0



Configuration items required on the server side:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  **TRANSFERED_FILES_DIR**
    Path of the directory where the transfered files will be copied. The
    directory must be empty and will be managed entirely by Soma-workflow.

    .. warning::
      Do not copy any file in this directory. Soma_workflow manages the
      entire directory and might delete any external file.

  **SERVER_NAME** (to be replace with DB_SERVER_NAME, will be clearer)
    Name of the database server.

.. _conf_server_option:

Configuration items optional on the server side:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  **DATABASE_FILE**
    Path of the SQLite database file. The file will be created the first time
    the database server will be started.

    This option was mandatory up to soma-workflow-2.6, and is optional since
    2.7. Additionally in 2.7, the database version number will be appended to
    the database file name, to avoid mixing several incompatible databases when
    switching between different soma-workflow versions.

  **MAX_JOB_IN_QUEUE**
    Maximum number of job in each queue. If a queue does not appear here,
    Soma-workflow considers that there is no limitation.
    The syntax is "{default_queue_max_nb_jobs} queue_name1{max_nb_jobs_1} queue_name_2{max_nb_job_2}". Example: "{5} test{20}"

  **MAX_JOB_RUNNING** (new in 2.8)
    Like MAX_JOB_IN_QUEUE, but also limits the number of jobs which may be
    running through a given queue. It thus includes actually running jobs, plus
    queued jobs (which may get to running status at any time).

    Note that cluster queues may impose their own running jobs limits, which
    are not controlled by this parameter, thus the minimum limit will actually
    be effective.

  **PATH_TRANSLATION_FILES**
    Specify here the shared resource path translation files, mandatory to use
    the SharedResourcePath objects (see :ref:`shared-resource-path-concept`).
    Each translation file is associated with a namespace. That way several
    applications can use the same  identifiers without risk.
    The syntax is "namespace_1{translation_file_path_11}
    namespace1{translation_file_path_12} namespace2{translation_file_path_2}"

  **DRMAA_IMPLEMENTATION**
    Set this item to "PBS" if you use FedStage PBS DRMAA 1.0 implementation,
    otherwise it does not has to be set.
    Soma-workflow is designed to be independent of the DRMS and the DRMAA
    implementation. However, we found two bugs in the FedStage PBS DRMAA 1.0
    implementation, and correct it temporarily writing specific code for this
    implementation in Soma-workflow at 2 locations (soma_workflow.engine Drmaa
    class: __init__ and submit_job method).

  **NATIVE_SPECIFICATION**
    Some specific option/function of the computing resource you want to use
    might not be available among the list of Soma-workflow Job attributes.
    Use the native specification attribute to use these specific functionalities.
    Once configured it will be applied to every jobs submitted to the resource
    unless a different value is specified in the Job attribute native_specification.

    *Example:* Specification of a job walltime and more:
      * using a PBS cluster: NATIVE_SPECIFICATION= -l walltime=10:00:00,pmem=16gb
      * using a SGE cluster: NATIVE_SPECIFICATION= -l h_rt=10:00:00

  **SCHEDULER_TYPE**
    Scheduler type:
      **local_basic**: simple builtin scheduler (the one used for the local single process mode). It may be used also on a remote machine (without DRMS support).

      **drmaa**: cluster or grid scheduler, based on DRMAA. This is the scheduler used normally on servers, and is the default in such a case.

      **mpi**: mono-process scheduler using MPI for the :ref:`Mono process application on clusters <light_mode_config>` (light) mode.

  **SHARED_TEMPORARY_DIR**
    Directory where to generate temporary files used between jobs. The directory should be visible by all processing nodes (on a cluster), and the filesystem should be large enough to store temporary files during a whole workflow execution.

  .. _container_command:

  **CONTAINER_COMMAND**
    This item is a prefix prepended to all jobs commands. It is typically used to drive execution through a container system such as `singularity <https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/>`_ or `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_. In this situation, jobs commandlines have to specify the container command and options, for instance:

    .. code-block:: bash

        singularity exec --bind /data_dir /opt/singularity_images/appropriate_image.simg command_to_run arg1 arg2...

    The **CONTAINER_COMMAND** parameter will allow to build the container-related beginning for jobs commandlines. It is actually a list, given in a python syntax. Shell Environment variables replacement is allowed, and a special pattern, ``{#command}`` allows to replace the actual job commanline at a given location.

    This config variable has appeared in Soma-Workflow 2.10.

    Let's take a simple example first::

        container_command = ['singularity', 'exec', '--bind', '/data_dir', '--bind', '/software_dir', '/opt/singularity_images/appropriate_image.simg', 'entrypoint']

    Here, the job command will be appended after the ``entrypoint`` program (if defined in the container image) which will run inside *singularity*. Let's suppose the job commandline is ``['ls', '/']``, the command which will be actually run is:

    .. code-block:: bash

        singularity exec --bind /data_dir --bind /software_dir /opt/singularity_images/appropriate_image.simg entrypoint ls /

    Now if we need further customization, for instance to set a library path variable to access a library with custom installation, we will need to run a shell to setup the variable then run the program:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sh -c 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/software_dir/lib:$"LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ls /'

    Here the job command with arguments must be within the ``'`` quotes after ``sh -c`` to run in the shell command. Then the **CONTAINER_COMMAND** variable for Soma-Workflow has to be::

        container_command = ['singularity', 'exec', '--bind', '/data_dir', '--bind', '/software_dir', '/opt/singularity_images/appropriate_image.simg', 'sh', '-c', 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/ software_dir/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" entrypoint {#command}']

    This variable, being set only on server-side, allows to run workflows not aware of any container system on the computing resource, and can be set differently (or not set) on different computing resources.

Logging configuration:

  **SERVER_LOG_FILE**
    Server log file path.

  **SERVER_LOG_LEVEL**
    Server logging level as defined in the `logging
    <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ module.

  **SERVER_LOG_FORMAT**
    Server logging format as defined in the `logging <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ module.

  **ENGINE_LOG_DIR**
    Directory path where to store Workflow Engine log files.

  **ENGINE_LOG_LEVEL**
    Workflow Engine logging level as defined in the `logging
    <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ module.

  **ENGINE_LOG_FORMAT**
    Workflow Engine logging level as defined in the `logging
    <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ module.

Parallel job configuration:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The items described here concern the parallel job configuration. A parallel job
uses several CPUs and involves parallel code: MPI, OpenMP for example.

.. warning::
  The documentation is under construction.


..
  OCFG_PARALLEL_COMMAND = "drmaa_native_specification"
  OCFG_PARALLEL_JOB_CATEGORY = "drmaa_job_category"

  ..
    PARALLEL_DRMAA_ATTRIBUTES = [OCFG_PARALLEL_COMMAND, OCFG_PARALLEL_JOB_CATEGORY]

  OCFG_PARALLEL_PC_MPI="MPI"
  OCFG_PARALLEL_PC_OPEN_MP="OpenMP"

  ..
    PARALLEL_CONFIGURATIONS = [OCFG_PARALLEL_PC_MPI, OCFG_PARALLEL_PC_OPEN_MP]

  OCFG_PARALLEL_ENV_MPI_BIN = 'SOMA_JOB_MPI_BIN'
  OCFG_PARALLEL_ENV_NODE_FILE = 'SOMA_JOB_NODE_FILE'

  ..
    PARALLEL_JOB_ENV = [OCFG_PARALLEL_ENV_MPI_BIN, OCFG_PARALLEL_ENV_NODE_FILE]


Obsolete config entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**NAME_SERVER_HOST** removed in v3, this was for the Pyro name server.



.. _light_mode_config:

Mono process application on clusters
====================================

This mode is called light mode, it is the installation you need if you are
not interested in the remote access and disconnection features (see :ref:`client_server_application_concept`)

Requirements
------------

The requirements are identical to the server installation requirements.
If you do not intend to access an other computing resource with the remote
access feature, the installation of zmq can be skipped.

The requirements are thus:

* A distributed resource management system (DRMS) such as Grid Engine, Condor,
  Torque/PBS, LSF..
* A implementation of `DRMAA <http://www.drmaa.org/>`_ 1.0 for the DRMS in C if available, unless a specific :doc:`scheduler exists <scheduler>`
* Python *version 2.7 or more*
* SQLite *version 3 or more*
* For the GUI: Qt *version 4.6.2 or more*, `PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ *version 4.7.2 or more*, or `PySide <http://www.pyside.org>`_ *version 1.1.1* or more, and optionally `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ *version 0.99 or more*

More details about the implementation of DRMAA can be found in the server
installation section (see :ref:`server_requirements`).


Installation
------------



1. Choose a resource identifier for the computing resource, ex: "Local Titan"

2. Create a configuration file (see :ref:`light_mode_configuration`) at the location $HOME/.soma-workflow.cfg. You can also choose your own path for the configuration file and set the "SOMA_WORKFLOW_CONFIG" environment variable with this path or put it in the /etc/ directory.

Start the GUI with the command *soma_workflow_gui* and/or import the soma.workflow.client module to use the Python API.

.. seealso:: :ref:`gui` for the GUI documentation, :ref:`client_api` for Soma-workflow Python API documentation and :ref:`examples`.

.. _light_mode_configuration:

Configuration
-------------

This section defines the required and optional configuration items for the light
mode.

The configuration file syntax is the `ConfigParser
<http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_  syntax. All the
configuration items are defined in one section. The section name corresponds to
the name you chose for the resource: "Local Titan" in the example.

Configuration file example: ::

  [Local Titan]

  LIGHT_MODE    = True

  TRANSFERED_FILE_DIR = path/soma_workflow.db
  DATABASE_FILE       = path/transfered_files

..
  If you want to use the same application as a client to other computing resources,
  make sure that Pyro was installed and add the configuration items required in the
  configuration file as described here: :ref:`client_configuration`.

  Configuration file example: ::

    [Local Titan]

    LIGHT_MODE    = True

    TRANSFERED_FILE_DIR = path/soma_workflow.db
    DATABASE_FILE       = path/transfered_files


    [LabDesktops]

    CLUSTER_ADDRESS     = mydesktop.mylab.fr
    SUBMITTING_MACHINES = mydesktop



*Required configuration items:*

  **LIGHT_MODE**
    This item can be set up with any value, however it must be defined to use
    soma_workflow in the light mode.

  **TRANSFERED_FILE_DIR**
    Path of the directory where the transfered files will be copied. The
    directory must be empty and will be managed entirely by Soma-workflow.
    This item is required to let you run workflow with file transfer for
    test purposes in the light mode.

    .. warning::
      Do not copy any file in this directory. Soma_workflow manages the
      entire directory and might delete any external file.

*Optional configuration items:*

  Many optional configuration item can be added to customize the installation, see
  :ref:`server_configuration` for a full list of the items and their description.

  In addition, a few more optional configuration items are available:

  **DATABASE_FILE**
    Path of the SQLite database file. The file will be created the first time
    the application is launch.

    This option was mandatory up to soma-workflow-2.6, and is optional since
    2.7. Additionally in 2.7, the database version number will be appended to
    the database file name, to avoid mixing several incompatible databases when
    switching between different soma-workflow versions.

  **SOMA_WORKFLOW_DIR** (new in 2.7)
    Directory which will contain soma_workflow files (typically, the SQlite
    database, and file transfers).

  In addition :ref:`Local scheduler options <local_sched_config>` can be used in the configuration: **CPU_NB**, **MAX_CPU_NB**, and **SCHEDULER_INTERVAL**.


Server configuration examples
=============================

Local mode on a server, with client/server access
-------------------------------------------------

This mode allows remote access from a client to a computing server which does not have any DRMS and is using Soma-Workflow's local (simple) scheduler.

.. note:: It is better not to use the local scheduler on machines shared between several users, as this basic scheduler does not handle inter-user load very well.

Server configuratinon (``$HOME/.soma-workflow.cfg``):
::

  [averell]

  CLUSTER_ADDRESS     = averell.mylab.fr
  SUBMITTING_MACHINES = averell.mylab.fr
  LOGIN = my_login
  SCHEDULER_TYPE = local_basic
  SERVER_NAME = averell
  ENGINE_LOG_DIR = /home/my_login/.soma_workflow/averell/logs
  TRANSFERED_FILE_DIR = /home/my_login/.soma_workflow/averell/file_transfers
  DATABASE_FILE = /home/my_login/.soma_workflow/averell/soma_workflow.db

.. _local_sched_config:

The local scheduler also uses its own config file (``$HOME/.soma-workflow-scheduler.cfg``):

The scheduler options are:

  **CPU_NB**
    Number of CPU cores to be used.
    May be 0.
    From Soma-workflow 2.8, this number is not a maximum any longer, but rather a minimum. See MAX_CPU_NB.

  **MAX_CPU_NB** (new in 2.8)
    Maximum number of CPU cores to be used.
    0 means all processors detected on the machine.
    The number of processors used (provided there are enough jobs to feed them) is at least CPU_NB, and at most MAX_CPU_NB, depending on the machine load at the time of job submission.
    This load adjustment allows to use soma-workflow on a shared machine using the local scheduler. However this load adjustment is not an advanced load balancing feature, it is a cheap solution to avoid heavy overloading, but it is very limited and approximative.

    When not specified (or zero), the number of available cores will be used as max, and 0 as cpu_nb.

  **SCHEDULER_INTERVAL**
    Polling interval for the scheduler, in seconds. The default is 1 second.

Ex:
::

  [averell]

  CPU_NB = 2
  MAX_CPU_NB = 16
  SCHEDULER_INTERVAL = 1
